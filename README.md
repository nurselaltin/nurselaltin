### Hello , I'm Nursel . ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Backend Developer . Actually , I was a Food Enginering.

My curiosity to learn how a system is set up, developed and managed led me to the field of technology.

I started  in 2019 this journey . I started with PHP , HTML ,CSS .
Long time ago , I started with C# , .NET . 
Now , I am developing project with C# , .NET Core on Backend side and Html, CSS and Javascript - Jquery on Frontend  side.

I don't know where my passion for learning will take me in the days to come. 

Right now I am focused on enjoying this journey.

I am sharing my journey on instagram.You can check this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43447965/145212502-ef26911d-8ac6-4db3-b623-bd995feae4fa.png)
